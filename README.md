# ProCore Client
ProCore (short for Professional Core) is a complete replacement to the shitty Core Graphical User Interface on ROBLOX's client + Studio.

# Development
This is a open-source project! Help us develop!
I will be taking any non-malicious pull requests.

# Installation
Not going to update a model with all of this often, but this is really easy to compile yourself.
When it's at a stable release I will most likely start using a model because it will be easier for less advanced users.
