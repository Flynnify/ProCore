# ProCore Client
ProCore (short for Professional Core) is a complete replacement to the Core Graphical User Interface on ROBLOX's client + Studio.


The design is inspired by Andy Liang, which you can see here:

# Development
This is a open-source project! Help us develop!
I will be taking any non-malicious pull requests.

# Installation
Not going to update a model with all of this often, but this is really easy to compile yourself.
When it's at a stable release I will most likely start using a model because it will be easier for less advanced users.

#Compile files
A lot of files in the repository is labeled "xml". This is because you need to compile them.


To compile a file, you need to download the XML source file, and change the file extension from "XML" to "RBXMX". From there you can go to Studio > Model tab > the icon with an arrow going down labeled "Model".


You choose the file, and ta da! you have the compiled file!
